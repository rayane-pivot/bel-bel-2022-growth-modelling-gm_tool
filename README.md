#GROWTH MODELLING (GM)

The growth modelling project aims to help **BEL** analyse their *brands*, their *markets*, and set *achievable strategic growth* plans for the next $3$ years based on the models we built and the insights we gathered. 

This repository contains all the technicals we put in place for producing the materials we presented during the workshops. The summary of the previous being divided into three part *Assess-Plan-Attack*, each one consisting of precise key insights we had to compute in order to help BEL understand their surroundings, project themselves up to $3$ years in the future, and achieve their growth. 

The **GM** project were adapted and presented to different countries in which **BEL** is implanted. 

Therefore the materials had to be automated and adapted to the realities of these countries. 

Among the insights we computed for **BEL** we have : 

## Positioning Matrix 

## Forecast Categories
which consists of forecasting the distinct categories of cheese, which are present in a given country. Categories that are different from one country to another. In some country, given the huge number of categories, some not totally useful due the size of the markets, we sometimes focused on the markets which seem to be more valuable. 

## Forecast Brands

## Growth Drivers Past 

## Capacity to win

## Attack on New Market (Assess-Compare-Forecast)
